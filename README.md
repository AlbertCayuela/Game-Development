#Slingshot Adventure

This is a little game made by two students of the Videogame Desing and Develompent degree. It's more like a prototype because we could't fix it all but its a small plataformer with two levels, where the player can move right, left and jump.
The game has been made using C++, SDL and pugi libraries. 
The maps have been made using tiled as the coliders.

 ##Controls
 
Movement with arrow keys:
A: walk left
D: walk right

 SPACE: jump
